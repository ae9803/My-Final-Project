#ValeroApp
Basic application demonstrating MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) Integration with Google Maps. App allows the user to view Valero Locations. Also allows the user to select a radius of stores. 

#Struggles I had

I wanted to create a login area and a sidebar for the user to allow them to login and to allow them store locations for future use. Also, tried to work on google streets to allow a close view of the store, but I failed to pull the service and had to abandon the idea.
